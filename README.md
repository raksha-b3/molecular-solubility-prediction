# molecular-solubility-prediction
Machine learning–based prediction of aqueous solubility (logS) of chemical compounds using RDKit molecular descriptors and Random Forest regression.

This repository contains a learning-based mini project created to explore machine learning applications in cheminformatics.
This project predicts aqueous solubility (logS) of chemical compounds using molecular descriptors
and a Random Forest regression model.

Tools used:
- Python
- RDKit
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

Done as a mini project by Raksha B and Aarthi R.
